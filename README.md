**Problem:**

- Personally I'm not a linux guru and I'm not so familiar with linux deamons but did get a task up and running automatically with the Raspberry Zero. The task was a simple code, a `Hello World` in that the code used a GPIO pin to blink an LED. When the RPI Zero booted, the software started automatically via `/etc/rc.local` Any help from the linux world will be most appreciative.

- The goal of this project is to interface the I2C protocol between the MD25 and BCM2835 Library.
